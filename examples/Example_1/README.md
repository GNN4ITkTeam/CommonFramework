## Quickstart

Assuming the CommonFramework repo requirements have been installed, the only other requirements are the data files and model files. An example dataset can be downloaded with
```bash
wget https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/CTBnzv4DlntgHJ7/download?files=athena_100_events.zip
unzip athena_100_events.zip
```
and enter the password provided by the GNN4ITk team. The model files can be downloaded with
```bash
wget https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/Y72LOTgxUbP9mio/download?files=Example_1.zip
unzip Example_1.zip
```
and enter the password provided by the GNN4ITk team.

the following commands will run the example:

```bash
g4i-infer -c 
```
