# Core scripts and utilities

This directory contains the core scripts and utilities for the GNN4ITK framework. It is a simple backbone for running the stages (specified in [the stages directory](../stages/README.md)) using the command line. They are called from the command line using 
```bash
g4i-[train, infer, eval] my-config-file.yaml
``` 
Example config files can be found in the [examples directory](../../examples/README.md).
